Tiny VOM is a AVR microcontroller based volt-ohm meter.

Thanks for downloading this package.  This circuit and accompanying code is designed
as a "hello world" stub but can be made and used stand-alone.  You are encouraged to
cut and paste the code and functionality into larger circuits in the AVR family.

If you make changes or additions and would like to add your modifications to the tree,
please send a message to the user "yourcelf" via github, or email cfd@mit.edu to be
added as a collaborator.  Get a github ID first and tell him what that is.

If you have difficulty with the public key, go to your "account", and click
on "need help with public key".  You'll want to scroll down to find instructions to
make a config file for ssh for your operating system.  After you try this and you're
really stuck, you can try emailing Charlie (that's cfd, above) for help.  The business
with the keys makes it much better to be doing this on your own machine rather than
a shared public computer.  If this presents a big problem, mail Charlie to see
what work arounds he might have thought of since this writing.

Once you have your github ID and public key all set, go back to the shared repository.
To clone the entire repository, use:

git clone git@github.com:yourcelf/Tiny-VOM.git
